## Overview

This project is a simple yet effective text summarizer built using Python and Streamlit. The text summarizer takes a piece of text as input and generates a concise summary, helping users extract key information and save time reading lengthy documents.

## Features

- Easy-to-use interface with Streamlit for interactive text summarization.
- Utilizes natural language processing techniques to extract essential information.
- Adjustable summarization length to control the level of detail in the output.
- Supports multiple languages for summarization.

## Implementation Details

- The text summarization algorithm is based on the [Spacy] library.
- Streamlit is used to create the interactive web application for the summarizer.
- The app employs extractive summarization, which identifies and selects the most important sentences from the input text to form the summary.

## Acknowledgments

- The Spacy community for providing valuable resources and tools.
- Streamlit developers for creating an excellent framework for building web apps with Python.
